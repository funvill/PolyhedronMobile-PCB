# dodecahedron-pcb

A [Regular dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_dodecahedron) is made of 12 regular [pentagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon) faces.

In this project 12 pentagon PCBs with LEDS are welded together using solder at the vertexs. The hole in the center is to insert the controller and batteries into the center.
